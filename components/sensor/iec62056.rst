IEC 62056-21
=============

*IEC 62056-21* is an international standard for a protocol to exchange data with utility meters. Mostly for electricity but also water, thermal and other meters. It was previously known as *IEC 61107*.

    :description: Instructions for setting up IEC 62056-21 meter component in ESPHome.
    :image: iec62056-21.svg

The ``iec62056`` component allows you to read data from any compatible meter. It requires a *serial port* and *an external optical interface*. Data exchange uses an infrared optical channel. Compatible meters are equipped with a characteristic round metal plate with two opto-elements inside. The protocol could be used with other transport layers, e.g. current loop but the component was tested only with the optical interface.

It supports 4 modes of IEC 62056-21: A, B, C, and D.

The component does not support programming. Setting meter configuration parameters requires a secret password which makes it impossible to use by ordinary users.

There are other smart meter standards that use the same optical interface. Although they share some common concepts they are not compatible.

Theory of operation
-------------------

The component operates in 2 main modes:

* **Bidirectional** communication with a meter. In this mode, a meter sends data only when requested. It requires an IR receiver and transmitter. This is mode A, B and C according to IEC 62056-21.
* **Unidirectional** communication, where a meter sends data to a probe from time to time. It requires only an IR receiver. In `IEC 62056-21` terminology it is mode D.

Modes A, B, C
*************

The component reads data for the first time 15 seconds after boot-up. First, it sends an identification request at 300 bps.
The meter returns the maximum baud rate it can handle. Following that, the serial port baud rate is changed to the value provided by
the meter or configured by option :ref:`baud_rate_max <iec62056_platform_config>`. The meter transmits data registers with associated OBIS codes.

If the transmission has failed (bad checksum or invalid format), the component will try to read data again but this time using a slower transmission speed. For every retry, the speed is decreased. The number of retires and delays can be configured.

If the meter is battery-powered, a special wake-up sequence can be applied. This happens only when :ref:`battery_meter <iec62056_platform_config>` is set to ``True``.


Mode D
******

For meters operating in mode D, you only need an IR receiver as transmission to a meter is not supported. In this mode, the meter sends data every few seconds without any request. You should configure the serial port to match the meter transmission format. Unlike modes A, B, and C which is detected automatically, Mode D must be enabled manually by setting ``mode_d=True`` in the platform configuration.


OBIS codes
**********

The :abbr:`OBIS (Object Identification System )` code identifies the different readings from a meter. The code consists of up to 6 group sub-identifiers.
The code is formatted like this: ``A-B:C.D.E*F``, where:

* ``A`` - medium: 0=abstract objects, 1=electricity, 6=heat, 7=gas, 8=water
* ``B`` - channel, 0=no channel available
* ``C`` - physical value, e.g. current, voltage, temperature.
* ``D`` - measurement type, 
* ``E`` - tariff, 0=total, 1=tariff #1, 2=tariff #2 and so on
* ``F`` - billing period

``A``, ``B``, and ``F`` may be omitted. Codes may use hexadecimal digits, for example, code ``15.8.0`` could be represented
as ``F.8.0``.

The codes are standardized but devices send a different number of codes. To get a list of codes supported by your meter enable ``DEBUG`` 
log for ``iec62056`` component and observe the log output. Sample output:

.. code-block::

    [10:50:12][D][iec62056.component:416]: Data: '1-0:15.8.1(00000009999.567*kWh)'
    [10:50:12][D][iec62056.component:416]: Data: '1-0:15.8.2(00000000000.000*kWh)'
    [10:50:12][D][iec62056.component:416]: Data: '1-0:15.8.3(00000000000.000*kWh)'
    [10:50:12][D][iec62056.component:416]: Data: '1-0:15.8.4(00000000000.000*kWh)'

.. note::

    Sensor OBIS code must match exactly what is transmitted from a meter. This is the part before the first bracket ``(``.

Hardware 
--------

To communicate with a meter you must attach an optical interface to the serial port. The interface consists of an infrared LED and phototransistor. In addition, the device must be equipped with a ring magnet to keep it aligned with the meter. 

If the meter operates in unidirectional mode D, only an IR phototransistor is required.

Probe
*****

The standard defines the maximum dimensions of the probe that can be attached to a meter. It must be equipped with a magnet as it is the only way to keep the probe in a stable position.

Configuration
-------------

To see meter data in Home Assistant you must define a :ref:`sensor <iec62056_sensor>` or :ref:`text sensor <iec62056_text_sensor>` with the appropriate OBIS code. Note that meters support different sets of OBIS codes. By default, the component does not define any sensors.


Serial port
***********

The component requires  :ref:`UART bus <uart>`. The serial must be configured as *7E1* in most cases.
When ``mode_d=True`` baud rate must be set to a value supported by the meter. Usually 2400 or 9600 bps. For other modes (``mode_d=False``) the transmission speed is negotiated with a meter. ``baud_rate`` is ignored and can be any value.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example UART configuration entry
    uart:
        rx_pin: GPIO21
        tx_pin: GPIO22
        baud_rate: 9600
        data_bits: 7
        parity: EVEN
        stop_bits: 1

.. warning::

    For ESP8266 it is highly recommended to use hardware UART. Software UART
    cannot handle transmissions faster than 4800 bps.

You may need to disable logging if the optical probe is connected to the serial port used by the logger component. 

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Set baud_rate to 0 to disable logging via UART.
    logger:
        baud_rate: 0

Platform
********

To use the component you must define ``iec62056`` platform section in the configuration file. It consists of basic settings.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example platform configuration entry for bidirectional communication
    iec62056:
      update_interval: 60s
      baud_rate: 9600
      battery_meter: False

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example platform configuration entry for unidirectional communication
    iec62056:
      mode_d: True


.. _iec62056_platform_config:

Configuration variables
+++++++++++++++++++++++

- **update_interval** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`): The interval to read data from a meter.
  Defaults to ``15min``. ``never`` disables updates. In that case, a switch should be used to
  trigger readout. To get continuous readings use a small value like 1s.

- **baud_rate_max** (*Optional*, int): LLimits the maximum transmission speed to the specified value. By default, it is set to ``9600`` as it provides a stable connection. To disable it, set it to ``0``. That way you can use the maximum possible baud rate of ``19200`` if the meter supports it. For ESP8266 use the software UART set to ``4800`` or lower.

- **receive_timeout** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`): Maximum time component waits for data from a meter before reporting transmission error. Defaults to ``3s``.

- **battery_meter** (*Optional*, boolean): Set to true if a meter is battery-powered. That way special power-up sequence will be used.

- **retry_delay** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`): In case of transmission failure, time to wait before retrying transmission. Defaults to ``15s``.

- **retry_counter_max** (*Optional*, int): In case of transmission failure, the maximum number of retries. Defaults to ``2``.

- **uart_id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): Manually specify the ID of the :ref:`UART Component <uart>` if you want
  to use multiple UART buses.

- **mode_d** (*Optional*, boolean): Set to ``True`` if a meter sends data every few seconds. This forces the component to operate in mode D. In this mode data is never transmitted to a meter. If set, any other settings except ``receive_timeout`` are ignored. Don't forget to set UART baud rate the meter is using. If you are not sure try ``2400 7E1`` or ``9600 7E1``.

.. warning::

    Battery-powered meters typically limit the number of readings to preserve energy, e.g. to 4 readings a day. If a meter does not impose the limit, frequent readings may significantly decrease battery life.

.. _`iec62056_sensor`:

Sensor
******

The sensor reports the first value between brackets from the record. For the following data

.. code-block:: text

    1-0:15.6.0(00000006000.385*kW)(2000-01-01 20:10:30)

the sensor value is ``6000.385``. To get the second value (date/time in this example) use a `Text Sensor`_.

The sensor supports only decimal values. If the record contains data in any other format you have to use `Text Sensor`_
and optionally lambda to convert it to a number.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example sensor configuration entries
    sensor:
      - platform: iec62056
        obis: 1-0:15.8.0

        accuracy_decimals: 3
        device_class: energy
        state_class: measurement


Configuration variables
+++++++++++++++++++++++

- **obis** (*Required*): OBIS code.
- All other options from  :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.

.. _`iec62056_text_sensor`:

Text Sensor
***********

The text sensor provides readout data as a text. In contrast to Sensor, you can select
which part of the readout is reported and even send the entire data record back to Home Assistant.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Sample text sensor configuration
    # Data record:
    # 1-0:15.6.0(00000006000.385*kW)(2000-01-01 20:10:30)

    - platform: iec62056
      obis: 1-0:15.6.0
      group: 2 # "2000-01-01 20:10:30"
      name: Date time

    - platform: iec62056
      obis: 1-0:15.6.0
      group: 1 # "00000006000.385"
      name: Value

    - platform: iec62056
      obis: 1-0:15.6.0
      group: 0 # "1-0:15.6.0(00000006000.385*kW)(2000-01-01 20:10:30)"
      name: The entire record

Configuration variables
+++++++++++++++++++++++

- **obis** (*Required*): OBIS code. You may define multiple text sensors with the same OBIS but a different group.
- **group** (*Optional*, int): Value group, ``0``, ``1``, or ``2``. Defaults to ``1``. If set to ``0``, the entire data record is reported
  including OBIS code. ``1`` reports the first value, ``2`` the second one.
- All other options are from :ref:`Text Sensor <config-text_sensor>`.

Data conversion
+++++++++++++++

If a meter reports data as a non-decimal value you can convert it automatically using a template sensor and lambda. Let's assume the meter sends a record like the following one with hex-encoded data:

.. code-block:: text

    0-0:96.8.0*255(ABCDEF00)

First, create a template sensor that will publish data as a decimal value.

.. code-block:: yaml

  sensor:
    - platform: template
      id: hex_to_dec_sensor
      name: "Converted hexadecimal number"

Now create a text sensor that will receive data as a string, convert it to decimal and publish.

.. code-block:: yaml

  text_sensor:
    - platform: iec62056
      id: hex_sensor
      obis: 0-0:96.8.0*255
      name: Hex content
      internal: True
      on_value:
        lambda: |-
          std::string hex_str = id(hex_sensor).state;
          uint32_t dec=std::stoul(hex_str, nullptr, 16);
          ESP_LOGI("iec62056.component", "Converted HEX '%s' to %u decimal", hex_str.c_str(), dec);
          id(hex_to_dec_sensor).publish_state((float)dec);

Every time the text sensor receives a new value, it converts it to a decimal and publishes it using the sensor with id ``hex_to_dec_sensor``. The ``internal`` flag prevents the sensor to be visible in Home Assistant. In the log you should see:

.. code-block:: text

  [I][iec62056.component:127]: Converted HEX 'ABCDEF00' to 2882400000 decimal

The same results can be obtained using Home Assistant lambdas. In this scenario, text sensor publishes hexadecimal value and
Home Assistant template sensor makes conversion.

Switch
******

The switch provides the ability to trigger readout on request. When the state is changed from ``OFF`` to ``ON``
the component initiates data transmission from a meter. You can use the switch in automation.

Configuration variables from  :ref:`Switch <config-switch>` can be used.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Sample switch configuration
    switch:
      - platform: iec62056
        name: 'Readout Trigger'

You cannot trigger readout in mode D.

Binary Sensor
*************

Set to ``ON`` when transmission to a meter begins. ``OFF`` when the transmission is finished.

You can use all configuration variables from :ref:`Binary Sensor <config-binary_sensor>`.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Sample automation to turn LED on when data read from a meter
    switch:
      - platform: gpio
        pin: GPIO2
        name: Internal LED
        id: led_switch
        internal: True
      
    binary_sensor:
      - platform: iec62056
        id: meter_status
        name: Meter Connection Status
        on_press:
          then:
            - switch.turn_on: led_switch
        on_release:
          then:
            - switch.turn_off: led_switch

Troubleshooting
---------------

* Make sure the probe is properly aligned with the optical elements on the meter.
* Meters are usually installed in not very clean areas. You may need to remove dust from the optical interface from time to time.
* If you encounter transmission and BCC checksum errors decrease the baud rate using ``baud_rate_max`` setting.
* If your device handles multiple sensors that spend a lot of time in the update loop you may need to increase the serial port buffer size. Especially if you note transmission problems when additional sensors are enabled but not when they are disabled.
